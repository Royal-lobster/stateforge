# Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)

## Theory

### What is a DFA?

A **Deterministic Finite Automaton** is one of the simplest models of computation. It reads an input string one symbol at a time, moving between a finite set of states according to fixed rules, and ultimately **accepts** or **rejects** the string.

The key word is *deterministic*: for every state and input symbol, there is **exactly one** next state. No ambiguity, no choices, no backtracking.

### Formal definition

A DFA is defined as a 5-tuple **(Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F)**:

| Component | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Q** | Finite set of states | {q₀, q₁, q₂} |
| **Σ** | Input alphabet (finite set of symbols) | {a, b} |
| **δ** | Transition function: Q × Σ → Q | δ(q₀, a) = q₁ |
| **q₀** | Initial (start) state, q₀ ∈ Q | q₀ |
| **F** | Set of accepting (final) states, F ⊆ Q | {q₂} |

The transition function δ is **total** — it must be defined for every (state, symbol) pair. If you have 3 states and 2 symbols, you need exactly 6 transitions defined.

### How it works

1. The DFA starts in the initial state q₀
2. It reads the input string left-to-right, one symbol at a time
3. For each symbol, it follows the transition δ(current_state, symbol) to the next state
4. After reading the entire string, if the current state is in F → **accept**; otherwise → **reject**

**Example:** A DFA that accepts strings over {a, b} containing an even number of `a`s:

```
States: {even, odd}     (even = q₀, start & accepting)
Alphabet: {a, b}

δ(even, a) = odd        δ(even, b) = even
δ(odd,  a) = even       δ(odd,  b) = odd

Input "abba":  even →a→ odd →b→ odd →b→ odd →a→ even  ✓ Accept
Input "ab":    even →a→ odd →b→ odd                     ✗ Reject
```

### DFA vs NFA: determinism explained

In a **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**:
- A state can have **multiple transitions** on the same symbol (or none at all)
- **ε-transitions** (moving without reading input) are allowed
- The NFA accepts if **any** possible path leads to an accepting state

In a **DFA**:
- **Exactly one** transition per (state, symbol) pair — no ambiguity
- **No ε-transitions** allowed
- The single computation path determines acceptance

Despite the NFA's apparent flexibility, **DFAs and NFAs are equivalent in power** — they recognize exactly the same class of languages (regular languages). Any NFA can be converted to a DFA via the **subset construction** algorithm, though the DFA may have exponentially more states.

### Language recognition

The **language** of a DFA *M*, written L(M), is the set of all strings it accepts:

> L(M) = { w ∈ Σ* | δ*(q₀, w) ∈ F }

where δ* extends δ to strings (processing one symbol at a time). A string is **accepted** if processing it from q₀ lands in an accepting state; otherwise it is **rejected**. Every string gets a definitive answer — there's no "maybe."

### Practical applications

- **Lexical analysis** — Compilers use DFAs to tokenize source code (recognizing keywords, identifiers, numbers)
- **Pattern matching** — Regular expressions compile to DFAs for fast string searching
- **Protocol verification** — Network protocols modeled as DFAs to verify correct message sequences
- **Hardware design** — Digital circuits implement DFAs for control logic
- **Text processing** — grep, sed, and similar tools use DFA-based engines

### Key properties

**Closure properties** — Regular languages (those recognized by DFAs) are closed under:
- **Union**: L₁ ∪ L₂ is regular if L₁ and L₂ are regular
- **Intersection**: L₁ ∩ L₂ is regular
- **Complement**: Σ* \ L is regular (just flip accepting/non-accepting states)
- **Concatenation** and **Kleene star**

**Equivalence with NFA** — Every NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA using **subset construction**. Each DFA state represents a *set* of NFA states.

**Minimization** — For every DFA, there exists a unique (up to renaming) **minimal DFA** recognizing the same language, with the fewest possible states. This can be computed efficiently using the table-filling algorithm.

### Limitations

DFAs can only recognize **regular languages**. They **cannot count** — any language requiring unbounded memory is beyond their reach.

**Pumping Lemma intuition:** Since a DFA has finitely many states, any sufficiently long input must revisit a state (pigeonhole principle). The loop between repeated visits can be "pumped" (repeated any number of times), and the string must still be accepted. This means:

- ❌ `{aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0}` — cannot match equal counts of a's and b's
- ❌ Balanced parentheses
- ❌ `{ww | w ∈ Σ*}` — cannot detect repeated halves
- ✅ `{w | w contains "abc"}` — fixed pattern matching
- ✅ `{w | |w| is divisible by 3}` — finite counting (mod)

For anything beyond regular languages, you need pushdown automata or Turing machines.

## Using DFA in StateForge

![DFA canvas view](/docs/canvas-dfa.png)

### Switching to DFA mode

DFA is the default mode when you open StateForge. You can switch to it anytime:

- Press <kbd>1</kbd> on your keyboard
- Or click the **DFA** tab in the top toolbar

### Building a DFA

#### Adding states

- **Double-click** on the canvas to create a new state
- Or select the **S tool** from the toolbar and click anywhere on the canvas
- States are labeled automatically (q₀, q₁, q₂, …)

#### Setting state properties

Right-click a state to access its context menu:

- **Set as Initial** — marks the state as the start state (shown with an arrow)
- **Set as Accepting** — marks the state as an accepting/final state (shown with a double circle)

#### Adding transitions

- Select the **T tool** from the toolbar
- Click a source state, then click the destination state
- A transition is created with the default symbol `a`
- Click the transition label to edit — you can change the symbol or add multiple symbols separated by commas
- Self-loops: click a state and then click it again

### DFA validation

The **Properties panel** in the sidebar automatically validates your DFA and shows errors:

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Multiple initial states | A DFA must have exactly one start state |
| ε-transition from qₙ | DFAs do not allow epsilon transitions |
| qₙ: multiple on 'x' | State qₙ has more than one transition on symbol x |

Fix all validation errors to ensure your automaton is a valid DFA.

### Simulation

StateForge provides two simulation modes for testing your DFA.

#### Single run

1. Enter an input string in the simulation input field
2. **Start** (<kbd>Enter</kbd>) — begins the simulation, highlighting the initial state
3. **Step** (<kbd>Enter</kbd>) — advances one symbol at a time, showing the current state and consumed input
4. **Fast Run** — processes the entire remaining input at once
5. **Reset** — clears the simulation

The simulation panel shows:
- The input string with the current position highlighted
- The current active state(s) highlighted on the canvas
- Active transition labels during stepping
- Final result: **Accepted** (landed on accepting state) or **Rejected**

#### Multi-run (batch testing)

1. Click the **Multi** tab in the simulation panel
2. Enter multiple test strings, one per line
3. Click **RUN ALL**
4. Results show each string with ✓ (accepted) or ✗ (rejected)
5. A summary shows how many passed (e.g., "3/5 pass")

This is ideal for verifying your DFA against a suite of test cases.

### Trap state (dead state)

A valid DFA requires transitions for **every** (state, symbol) pair. In practice, many transitions lead to a non-accepting "trap" or "dead" state from which there is no escape.

Click **+ Add Trap State** in the sidebar to automatically:
- Create a trap state (non-accepting, with self-loops on all symbols)
- Add missing transitions from existing states to the trap state

This ensures your DFA's transition function is total. The trap state button is available in both DFA and NFA modes.

### Conversions

#### From DFA

| Conversion | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Minimize** | Reduces the DFA to its minimal equivalent using the table-filling algorithm. Shows how many states were removed. |
| **FA → RE** | Converts the finite automaton to an equivalent regular expression using state elimination. |
| **FA → Grammar** | Converts to an equivalent right-linear (regular) grammar. |
| **Combine** | Product construction with another automaton. Supports **union**, **intersection**, **difference**, and **complement**. |

#### To DFA

| Conversion | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **NFA → DFA** | Subset construction — converts an NFA to an equivalent DFA. Each DFA state represents a set of NFA states. Shows step-by-step construction. |

For combine operations, you'll import or define a second automaton. Complement only requires the current DFA — it completes the DFA (adds trap state if needed) and flips all accepting/non-accepting states.

## Tips & common mistakes

### Forgetting the trap state

A DFA's transition function must be **total** — every state needs a transition for every symbol in the alphabet. If your DFA is missing transitions, it's technically incomplete.

**Fix:** Click **+ Add Trap State** in the sidebar to auto-generate missing transitions to a dead state.

### Multiple initial states

A DFA has **exactly one** initial state. If you accidentally mark multiple states as initial, the properties panel will flag this error.

**Fix:** Right-click the extra initial states and deselect "Initial."

### Using ε-transitions

Epsilon (ε) transitions are an NFA feature. They are **not allowed** in a DFA. If you add one, the validator will report an error.

**Fix:** Remove the ε-transition, or switch to NFA mode (<kbd>2</kbd>) if your design requires it. You can then convert NFA → DFA using subset construction.

### Duplicate transitions on the same symbol

If state q₁ has two different transitions on symbol `a` (going to different states), the automaton is nondeterministic — not a valid DFA.

**Fix:** Remove the duplicate transition. If you need nondeterminism, use NFA mode and convert to DFA afterward.

### General tips

- **Start simple** — sketch the DFA on paper first, identifying what each state "remembers"
- **Think in terms of state meaning** — label states by what property they track (e.g., "seen odd number of a's")
- **Test with edge cases** — use multi-run to test the empty string (ε), single characters, and boundary inputs
- **Minimize after building** — use the minimize conversion to clean up redundant states
- **Use complement for "not" languages** — if it's easier to build a DFA for the opposite language, build that and complement it
