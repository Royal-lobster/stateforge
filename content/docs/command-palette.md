# Command palette

Press <kbd>⌘K</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>) to open the command palette, a searchable list of every action in StateForge.

## Fuzzy search

Type in the search field to filter commands. The search uses fuzzy matching: characters must appear in order but don't need to be adjacent. For example, typing "exp" matches "Export JSON", "Export PNG", and "Export SVG". You can also search by category name (e.g., typing "mode" shows all mode-switching commands).

## Available commands

Commands are organized into categories:

→ **Mode:** Switch between DFA, NFA, PDA, Turing Machine, Mealy, Moore, CFG, and L-Systems. Each shows its keyboard shortcut (1-8).

→ **Tool:** Pointer (V), Add State (S), Add Transition (T), Delete Selected (Del).

→ **Action:** Undo, Redo, Select All, Clear All, Auto Layout, Zoom to Fit.

→ **Panel:** Toggle Sidebar, Toggle Simulation, Toggle Conversions.

→ **Export:** Share URL, Export JSON, Export PNG, Export SVG, Import File.

→ **Game:** Pumping Lemma Game (opens the interactive pumping lemma tool).
